## Current Development Workflow
As we are currently the sole developer on the project, we're using a simplified workflow:
- Create feature branches from develop as needed
- Once a feature branch is complete and tested, merge it directly back to develop (no PR required).  Always pull base branches from origin before merging into them.
- Run all tests before merging to ensure code quality

This approach will be revised when more developers join the project.
