# Practices MCP Server - Project Overview

## Introduction

The Practices MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation designed to enforce and facilitate development best practices across software projects. It focuses on standardizing and automating workflows around branching strategies, versioning, pull requests, and integration with development tools like GitHub and Jira.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Practices MCP Server is to:

1. **Enforce Development Standards** - Validate branch names, enforce version consistency, standardize PR formats
2. **Orchestrate Workflows** - Coordinate multi-step processes across different tools
3. **Provide Context-Aware Guidance** - Suggest appropriate actions based on project stage and context

## Project Goals

1. Extract and standardize the branching and versioning strategies from the Tribal project
2. Create a reusable MCP server that can be applied to any software project
3. Provide tooling for automating Git workflow best practices
4. Enable seamless integration with Jira and GitHub
5. Standardize PR descriptions and workflow automation
6. Make development practices configurable to different project types

## Core Features

### Branch Management
- Branch naming validation
- Branch type detection
- Base branch resolution
- Branch creation helpers

### Version Management
- Version consistency checking
- Version bumping automation
- Semantic versioning enforcement

### PR Workflow
- PR description generation
- PR preparation and validation
- PR workflow automation

### Integration
- Jira ticket management
- GitHub repository operations
- Workflow orchestration

## Target Audience

- Software development teams looking to standardize their Git workflows
- AI assistants like Claude to help enforce development practices
- CI/CD pipelines for automated validation
- Individual developers seeking guidance on Git best practices

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully extract branching and PR functionality from Tribal into standalone server
2. Configuration can be customized for different project types (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
3. Templates for common branching strategies (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-Based)
4. Integration with GitHub and Jira MCP servers
5. Automated testing validates branch names, PR formats, and versions

## Out of Scope

- Code review automation
- Deployment orchestration
- Performance metrics or analytics
- Replacing existing MCP servers for GitHub or Jira functionality

## Timeline

Initial development of the Practices MCP Server is planned in phases:

1. Planning and documentation (current phase)
2. Core functionality implementation
3. Integration with external MCP servers
4. Testing and refinement
5. Release and documentation
