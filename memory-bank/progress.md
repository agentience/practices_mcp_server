## Current Status

The project has moved from the **planning phase** to the **initial implementation phase**. We have completed the project scaffolding (PMS-1) and are now ready to begin implementing the core MCP server framework (PMS-2).

### Next Steps

1. Implement the MCP server framework (PMS-2)
2. Begin implementing branch management functionality (PMS-3)
3. Add version management functionality (PMS-4)
4. Develop PR preparation tools (PMS-5)
5. Create integrations with GitHub and Jira (PMS-6, PMS-7)
