## Current Status

The project is in the **planning phase**. We have completed the documentation and design of the system but have not yet begun implementation.

### Next Steps

1. Create Jira tickets for the implementation (PMS project)
2. Set up the initial project structure
3. Begin implementing the core functionality
4. Establish the testing framework
5. Develop the configuration system

## Known Issues

*None at this stage, as implementation has not begun.*
