## Current Status

The project has progressed through the **core functionality implementation phase** and has now completed several **infrastructure improvements**. We have completed the project scaffolding (PMS-1), implemented the core MCP server framework (PMS-2), migrated the branch management functionality (PMS-3), implemented version management functionality (PMS-4), completed pre-commit hooks and license headers (PMS-12), and implemented PR preparation tools (PMS-5). We have also established proper version management with our first minor version update to 0.2.0 (PMS-13). 

Most recently, we've migrated the build system to hatchling (PMS-14) and refactored the MCP server to use FastMCP implementation (PMS-15). We've successfully resolved MCP dependency issues (PMS-16) and completed the MCP server modernization (PMS-17), including verification that the server builds, installs, and runs correctly. We've also integrated the MCP server with Cline and the Claude desktop app for direct use. The GitHub integration (PMS-6) is complete, and we're now focusing on finalizing the Jira integration documentation (PMS-7), configuration system (PMS-8), and CLI enhancements (PMS-10).

### Next Steps

1. Implement configuration system (PMS-8)
2. Create strategy templates (PMS-9)
3. Document Jira integration (remaining part of PMS-7)
4. Implement CLI commands for PR and version features (PMS-10)

## Known Issues

None. The previous issue with the `mcp-python-sdk` dependency has been resolved by migrating to `mcp[cli]`, which is available in public registries.
