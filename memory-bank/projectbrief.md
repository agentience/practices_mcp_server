# Practices MCP Server - Project Brief

## Project Purpose

The Practices MCP Server is designed to extract, standardize, and automate the development best practices currently implemented in the Tribal project. The server will provide tools and resources for implementing branching strategies, versioning rules, PR workflows, and integration with services like GitHub and Jira.

## Core Objectives

1. **Extract Core Functionality**: Migrate branching, versioning, and PR helper functionality from Tribal to a standalone MCP server
2. **Standardize Development Practices**: Provide tools that enforce consistent development practices
3. **Enable Configurability**: Make practices configurable for different project types and preferences
4. **Integrate with Tools**: Leverage GitHub and Jira MCP servers to create complete workflows
5. **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Reduce manual effort through automation of common tasks

## Technical Goals

1. Implement a Python-based MCP server that exposes tools and resources
2. Create a configuration system for customizing practices
3. Build adapters for integration with other MCP servers
4. Provide templates for common project types and workflows
5. Ensure comprehensive testing and documentation

## Non-Goals

1. Recreating functionality already provided by GitHub and Jira MCP servers
2. Building IDE integrations (will be handled separately)
3. Implementing analytics or reporting features (future enhancement)
4. Supporting non-Git version control systems

## Success Criteria

1. All core functionality is successfully migrated from Tribal
2. The server can be used as a drop-in replacement for Tribal's branch/version/PR features
3. The server provides at least the same level of functionality as the current Tribal implementation
4. Documentation is clear and comprehensive
5. Tests provide good coverage of the functionality

## Key Components

1. **Branch Management**: Branch naming validation, creation, and type detection
2. **Version Management**: Version consistency checking, version bumping
3. **PR Workflows**: PR description generation, validation, and preparation
4. **Integration**: GitHub and Jira integration adapters
5. **Configuration**: Project-specific configuration system
6. **Templates**: Templates for branching strategies, PR descriptions, and more

## Timeline

The implementation will follow a phased approach, starting with core framework setup, progressing through module implementation, integration adapters, and culminating with a complete CLI and test suite. The timeline will be tracked through Jira tickets (PMS project).

## Stakeholders

- Tribal project maintainers
- Development teams using Tribal
- AI assistants leveraging MCP servers
- Future MCP server developers

## Resources

- Existing Tribal codebase for migration
- GitHub and Jira MCP servers for integration
- MCP SDK for server implementation
- Python ecosystem for development tools
