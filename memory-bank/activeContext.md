# Practices MCP Server - Active Context

## Current Project Status

We are now in the **initial implementation phase** of the Practices MCP Server project. The project scaffolding is complete, and we are ready to begin implementing the core functionality.

We have completed the following activities:

1. Created comprehensive documentation in the `instructions/` directory covering:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - System architecture and design
   - Implementation roadmap with Jira tickets
   - Branching and versioning strategies
   - Configuration system design
   - Resource template specifications
   - MCP tool specifications
   - Integration adapter designs
   - Jira workflow integration

2. Set up the memory bank for the project, which includes:
   - Project brief
   - Product context
   - System patterns
   - Technical context
   - This active context file
   - Progress tracking

3. Created the initial project scaffolding (PMS-1):
   - Set up the directory structure
   - Created `pyproject.toml` with dependencies
   - Implemented basic MCP server skeleton
   - Added CLI interface structure
   - Created module structure for branch, version, PR functionality
   - Set up testing infrastructure
   - Added CI/CD workflow

## Current Focus

Our current focus is on **implementing the core MCP server framework** (PMS-2). The key tasks at this stage are:

1. Completing the MCP server implementation
2. Implementing tool interfaces
3. Implementing resource interfaces
4. Setting up testing for the core framework

## Recent Decisions

### 1. Implementation Language

We have decided to implement the Practices MCP server in **Python**, the same language as Tribal. This will make it easier to extract and adapt the existing code.

### 2. Project Structure

We have chosen a modular project structure that separates concerns:
- `branch/` - Branch management functionality
- `version/` - Version management functionality
- `pr/` - PR workflow functionality
- `integrations/` - External integrations (GitHub, Jira)
- `templates/` - Resource templates
- `utils/` - Utility functions

### 3. Integration Strategy

We will leverage existing MCP servers for external integrations:
- `github` MCP server for GitHub operations
- `jira-server` MCP for Jira operations

This approach minimizes duplication and focuses our server on its core purpose.

### 4. Configuration Approach

We have chosen a YAML-based configuration system (`.practices.yaml`) that allows for:
- Project-specific customization
- Default templates for common project types
- Configurable branching strategies
- Flexible version file patterns

## Active Considerations

### 1. Code Migration Strategy

We need to determine the best approach for extracting code from Tribal:
- What code to extract verbatim vs. what to refactor
- How to maintain backward compatibility
- How to avoid disruption to Tribal users during the transition

### 2. Testing Strategy

Our testing strategy includes:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for interactions between components
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Mocked tests for external dependencies

### 3. Deployment Strategy

We need to decide on the deployment approach:
- Python package distribution
- Docker container deployment
- MCP settings integration

### 4. Documentation Strategy

We need to create comprehensive documentation:
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Configuration guides
- Contributing guidelines

## Current Blockers

There are no significant blockers at this time. The project is progressing as expected.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the MCP server framework (PMS-2)
2. Begin implementing branch management functionality (PMS-3)
3. Add version management functionality (PMS-4)
4. Develop PR preparation tools (PMS-5)
5. Create integrations with GitHub and Jira (PMS-6, PMS-7)

## Key Stakeholders

- Tribal project maintainers
- Development teams using Tribal
- AI assistants leveraging MCP servers
- Future MCP server developers

## Timeline Updates

The implementation is following the phased approach outlined in the implementation plan:

1. Initial Setup and Core Structure (PMS-1, PMS-2) - PMS-1 completed
2. Core Functionality Implementation (PMS-3, PMS-4, PMS-5)
3. Integration Implementation (PMS-6, PMS-7)
4. Configuration and Templates (PMS-8, PMS-9)
5. CLI and User Experience (PMS-10, PMS-11)

Each phase is being tracked with Jira tickets in the PMS project.
