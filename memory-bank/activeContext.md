# Practices MCP Server - Active Context

## Current Project Status

We are now in the **core functionality implementation phase** of the Practices MCP Server project. The project scaffolding is complete, and we have implemented several key components.

We have completed the following activities:

1. Created comprehensive documentation in the `instructions/` directory covering:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - System architecture and design
   - Implementation roadmap with Jira tickets
   - Branching and versioning strategies
   - Configuration system design
   - Resource template specifications
   - MCP tool specifications
   - Integration adapter designs
   - Jira workflow integration

2. Set up the memory bank for the project, which includes:
   - Project brief
   - Product context
   - System patterns
   - Technical context
   - This active context file
   - Progress tracking

3. Created the initial project scaffolding (PMS-1):
   - Set up the directory structure
   - Created `pyproject.toml` with dependencies
   - Implemented basic MCP server skeleton
   - Added CLI interface structure
   - Created module structure for branch, version, PR functionality
   - Set up testing infrastructure
   - Added CI/CD workflow

4. Implemented branch management functionality (PMS-3):
   - Branch name validation with configurable patterns
   - Branch creation following standardized naming conventions
   - Jira integration for issue status updates
   - CLI commands for branch operations
   - Unit tests for branch validator component

5. Implemented version management functionality (PMS-4):
   - Version validation with consistency checking
   - Version bumping with semantic versioning support
   - Integration with bump2version tool
   - CLI commands for version operations
   - Unit tests for version management

6. Implemented pre-commit hooks and license headers functionality (PMS-12):
   - Pre-commit hooks installation and management with tests
   - License header management with templates for different file types
   - CLI commands for hooks and headers operations
   - MCP tools for hooks and headers
   - LLM context instructions for AI assistants

## Current Focus

Our current focus is on **developing PR preparation tools** (PMS-5). We'll be working on:

1. ⬜ Extracting PR helper functionality from Tribal
2. ⬜ Implementing PR description generation
3. ⬜ Creating PR templates for different branch types
4. ⬜ Implementing PR preparation workflow
5. ⬜ Writing tests for PR functionality

## Recent Decisions

### 1. Implementation Language

We have decided to implement the Practices MCP server in **Python**, the same language as Tribal. This has made it easier to extract and adapt the existing code, as seen with branch management and version management functionality.

### 2. Project Structure

We have chosen a modular project structure that separates concerns:
- `branch/` - Branch management functionality
- `version/` - Version management functionality
- `pr/` - PR workflow functionality
- `integrations/` - External integrations (GitHub, Jira)
- `templates/` - Resource templates
- `utils/` - Utility functions

### 3. Integration Strategy

We will leverage existing MCP servers for external integrations:
- `github` MCP server for GitHub operations
- `jira-server` MCP for Jira operations

This approach minimizes duplication and focuses our server on its core purpose.

### 4. Configuration Approach

We have chosen a YAML-based configuration system (`.practices.yaml`) that allows for:
- Project-specific customization
- Default templates for common project types
- Configurable branching strategies
- Flexible version file patterns

### 5. Dependency Management

We have decided to use **uv** for dependency management and virtual environments:
- Creating virtual environments with `uv venv`
- Installing dependencies with `uv pip`
- Ensuring consistent dependency resolution
- Improved performance over traditional pip/venv

## Active Considerations

### 1. Code Migration Strategy

We evaluated the branch management code from Tribal:
- Refactored the branch validation logic for better testability
- Improved the branch creation workflow with more feedback
- Added direct Jira integration for issue status updates
- Enhanced error handling and result formatting

### 2. Testing Strategy

Our testing strategy includes:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for interactions between components
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Mocked tests for external dependencies

We've implemented unit tests for the branch validator component with good coverage.

### 3. Deployment Strategy

We need to decide on the deployment approach:
- Python package distribution
- Docker container deployment
- MCP settings integration

### 4. Documentation Strategy

We have updated the README with:
- Overview of branch management functionality
- Examples of using MCP tools
- CLI usage examples
- Installation and setup instructions
- Development workflow with uv

## Current Blockers

The `mcp-python-sdk` dependency may not be readily available in public registries, which could complicate installation. We're handling this by providing clear instructions and workarounds in the README.
