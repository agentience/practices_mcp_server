3. ⬜ Documenting Jira integration (remaining part of PMS-7)
4. ⬜ Implementing CLI commands for PR and version features (PMS-10)
5. ⬜ Adding parameter descriptions to MCP server tool registrations (PMS-23)

## Recent Decisions

### 1. Version Management and Compliance (PMS-13)

We have created a release branch and incremented our version number from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 to align with our versioning strategy. This process included:

- Creating a release/0.2.0 branch from develop
- Using bump2version to increment the minor version number
- Creating a CHANGELOG.md file following Keep a Changelog format
- Documenting completed features in the changelog

To ensure future compliance with our versioning strategy, we will follow these steps:
- After completing a set of features, create a release branch
- Bump the version number according to semantic versioning principles
- Update the CHANGELOG.md with new features and changes
- Merge the release branch to develop and main

### 2. Branching Strategy Enhancements

We have enhanced our branching strategy documentation with best practices for maintaining a clean repository history:
- Regular integration with the base branch to reduce merge conflicts
- Guidelines for creating logical, focused commits
- Local history cleanup using interactive rebasing (before pushing)
- Recommendations for descriptive branch names
- Regular repository cleanup to remove merged branches

We will continue to use the direct merge approach with `--no-ff` as documented, while following these practices to maintain a clean history.

### 3. Implementation Language

We have decided to implement the Practices MCP server in **Python**, the same language as Tribal. This has made it easier to extract and adapt the existing code, as seen with branch management and version management functionality.

### 4. Project Structure

We have chosen a modular project structure that separates concerns:
- `branch/` - Branch management functionality
- `version/` - Version management functionality
- `pr/` - PR workflow functionality
- `integrations/` - External integrations (GitHub, Jira)
- `templates/` - Resource templates
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `tools/` - MCP tools implementations with modern decorator pattern

### 5. Integration Strategy

We will leverage existing MCP servers for external integrations:
- `github` MCP server for GitHub operations
- `jira-server` MCP for Jira operations

This approach minimizes duplication and focuses our server on its core purpose.

### 6. Configuration Approach

We have chosen a YAML-based configuration system (`.practices.yaml`) that allows for:
- Project-specific customization
- Default templates for common project types
- Configurable branching strategies
- Flexible version file patterns

### 7. Dependency Management

We have implemented **uv** for dependency management and virtual environments:
- Creating virtual environments with `uv venv`
- Installing dependencies with `uv pip`
- Using lock files with `uv pip compile`
- Ensuring consistent dependency resolution through lock files
- Leveraging uv's managed mode for reliable dependency resolution
- Improved performance over traditional pip/venv

### 8. Jira Integration Approach

We have implemented a comprehensive Jira integration with:
- Issue status updates tied to branch creation (e.g., "In Progress" when starting work)
- Issue linking capabilities to connect related tickets
- Standardized error handling and response formatting
- Mock-based testing to ensure reliability without depending on actual Jira servers

### 9. MCP Server Implementation

We have made significant improvements to the MCP server implementation:
- Migrated from class-based implementation to modern decorator-based pattern
- Fixed import errors with direct imports from MCP libraries
- Simplified and improved the code organization with function-based structure
- Made tools registration more maintainable with clean patterns
- Verified the server can be built, installed, and run successfully

### 10. Integration with AI Assistants

We have successfully integrated the MCP server with AI assistants:
- Added server to Cline settings in VS Code
- Added server to Claude desktop app configuration
- Ensured the server works with existing MCP clients
- Used modern standards for MCP tools definitions

## Active Considerations

### 1. Repository Maintenance

We are actively maintaining a clean repository by:
- Deleting feature branches after they are merged to develop
- Following our documented branching strategy
- Keeping only active branches in the repository

Current active branches:
- `main` (production)
- `develop` (integration)
- `release/0.2.0` (current version update)

### 2. Code Migration Strategy

We evaluated the branch management code from Tribal:
- Refactored the branch validation logic for better testability
- Improved the branch creation workflow with more feedback
- Added direct Jira integration for issue status updates
- Enhanced error handling and result formatting

### 3. Testing Strategy

Our testing strategy includes:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for interactions between components
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Mocked tests for external dependencies

We enforce a strict requirement that **all tests must pass** before a feature is considered complete. This is reflected in our PR preparation workflow, which automatically checks for passing tests before marking a PR as ready for submission.

Key testing guidelines:
- New features must have corresponding tests
- Tests should cover both success and failure cases
- Tests should validate edge cases
- Test coverage should be maintained or improved
- Tests are considered part of the feature implementation, not an optional add-on

We've documented these test requirements in `docs/llm_context/pr_preparation_guide.md` to ensure all team members and clients understand the importance of this practice.

### 4. Deployment Strategy

We have implemented a deployment approach that includes:
- Python package distribution via PyPI
- Development mode installation with `uv pip install -e .`
- MCP settings integration in Cline and Claude desktop
- Command-line access via `practices-server` command

### 5. Documentation Strategy

We have updated the README with:
- Overview of branch management functionality
- Examples of using MCP tools
- CLI usage examples
- Installation and setup instructions
- Development workflow with uv

## Current Blockers

None. We have resolved several issues:
1. Successfully migrated from `mcp-python-sdk` to `mcp[cli]`, which resolves our previous dependency concerns. The project now uses standard packages available in public registries.
