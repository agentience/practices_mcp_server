# Practices MCP Server - Active Context

## Current Project Status

We are in the **planning phase** of the Practices MCP Server project. The goal is to extract the branching strategy, versioning, and PR workflow functionality from the Tribal project into a standalone MCP server that can be used by multiple projects.

We have completed the following planning activities:

1. Created comprehensive documentation in the `instructions/` directory covering:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - System architecture and design
   - Implementation roadmap with Jira tickets
   - Branching and versioning strategies
   - Configuration system design
   - Resource template specifications
   - MCP tool specifications
   - Integration adapter designs
   - Jira workflow integration

2. Setup the memory bank for the project, which now includes:
   - Project brief
   - Product context
   - System patterns
   - Technical context
   - This active context file
   - Progress tracking

## Current Focus

Our current focus is on **preparing for implementation**. The key tasks at this stage are:

1. Finalizing the planning documentation
2. Setting up the initial project structure
3. Creating Jira tickets for the implementation (PMS project)
4. Preparing for the extraction of code from Tribal

## Recent Decisions

### 1. Implementation Language

We have decided to implement the Practices MCP server in **Python**, the same language as Tribal. This will make it easier to extract and adapt the existing code.

### 2. Project Structure

We have chosen a modular project structure that separates concerns:
- `branch/` - Branch management functionality
- `version/` - Version management functionality
- `pr/` - PR workflow functionality
- `integrations/` - External integrations (GitHub, Jira)
- `templates/` - Resource templates

### 3. Integration Strategy

We will leverage existing MCP servers for external integrations:
- `github` MCP server for GitHub operations
- `jira-server` MCP for Jira operations

This approach minimizes duplication and focuses our server on its core purpose.

### 4. Configuration Approach

We have chosen a YAML-based configuration system (`.practices.yaml`) that allows for:
- Project-specific customization
- Default templates for common project types
- Configurable branching strategies
- Flexible version file patterns

## Active Considerations

### 1. Code Migration Strategy

We need to determine the best approach for extracting code from Tribal:
- What code to extract verbatim vs. what to refactor
- How to maintain backward compatibility
- How to avoid disruption to Tribal users during the transition

### 2. Testing Strategy

We need to establish a comprehensive testing strategy:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for interactions between components
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Mocked tests for external dependencies

### 3. Deployment Strategy

We need to decide on the deployment approach:
- Python package distribution
- Docker container deployment
- MCP settings integration

### 4. Documentation Strategy

We need to create comprehensive documentation:
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Configuration guides
- Contributing guidelines

## Current Blockers

There are no significant blockers at this time. The project is in the planning phase and progressing as expected.

## Next Steps

1. Create the Jira tickets for implementation (PMS project)
2. Set up the initial project structure
3. Begin implementing the core functionality
4. Establish the testing framework
5. Develop the configuration system

## Key Stakeholders

- Tribal project maintainers
- Development teams using Tribal
- AI assistants leveraging MCP servers
- Future MCP server developers

## Recent Communications

N/A - Project is in initial planning phase.

## Timeline Updates

The implementation will follow the phased approach outlined in the implementation plan:

1. Initial Setup and Core Structure (PMS-1, PMS-2)
2. Core Functionality Implementation (PMS-3, PMS-4, PMS-5)
3. Integration Implementation (PMS-6, PMS-7)
4. Configuration and Templates (PMS-8, PMS-9)
5. CLI and User Experience (PMS-10, PMS-11)

Each phase will be tracked with Jira tickets in the PMS project.
